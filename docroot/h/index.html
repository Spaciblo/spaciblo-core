					<h1>Help</h1>

					<p>Spacibl&#333; provides hosting tools for social VR on the web. For more information about the Spacibl&#333; project, visit <a href="https://spaciblo.org/">Spaciblo.org</a>.</p>
					
					<p>This site hosts several three dimensional web spaces that you can access with your web browser. While it is possible to enter the spaces using virtual reality (VR) headsets, they can also be accessed using your mobile phone handset, tablet, laptop, or desktop PC.</p>

					<h2>Getting started</h2>

					<h3>Without VR</h3>

					<p>If you want to take a look into a space without messing with VR, you can simply point a web browser like Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Edge at the web page for the space. A list of spaces is available on the <a href="/">front page</a> of this site.</p>

					<h3>With VR</h3>

					<p>Spacibl&#333; spaces use a technology called "WebVR" to enable VR headsets. Most browsers will ship WebVR support in late Summer of 2017, but in the meantime you'll need a development version of a browser.</p>

					<p>For desktop VR headsets like the HTC Vive or the Oculus Rift, follow <a href="">the instructions on webvr.rocks to install Firefox Nightly</a>.</p>

					<p>For Daydream headsets, follow <a href="">the instructions on webvr.rocks to install Chrome Canary</a>.</p>

					<p>For GearVR, you already have everything you need to enter the spaces. When you're in the GearVR home, choose the "internet" tab towards the bottom of the main UI to load your WebVR enabled browser.</p>

					<p>Once you have a WebVR enabled browser, you should see an "Enter VR" link on the bottom right of each space's web page. If you do not see the "Enter VR" link, then WebVR is not available on your browser or the VR headset has not been found by the browser. Double check the browser and settings and that your VR headset is connected and powered on to be ready for use.</p>

					<h2>Moving around and interacting</h2>

					<p>When you enter a space you will have a virtual body called an "avatar". If you have hand held controllers like a Vive wand, Oculus Touch, Daydream controller, or GearVR controller, then you will see your avatar's hand in its place.</p>

					<p>Each space will be designed with its own manner of movement. Most spaces allow your avatar to move in all three dimensions, like flying. Look below for how to move using your device.</p>

					<p>Things in spaces may react to you. The most common interaction method is for you to point at the thing and then press or trigger it by pressing a button. Look below for how to interact using your device.</p>

					<h3>On touch screens</h3>

					<p>When you have loaded a space's page, touch the screen to show the touch controls. You should see a two directional arrow appear toward the bottom of the screen. Drag your finger up and down or left and right on this arrow to move forward and back or left and right.

					<h3>On PCs</h3>

					<p>Use the arrow keys to move forward and back or to rotate to the left or right.</p>

					<p>The usual keyboard keys used in games are also available. w moves forward, s moves backward, a rotates to the left, and d rotates to the right.</p>

					<p>The full list of keyboard controls can be found on the <a href="">wiki keyboard controls page</a>.</p>

					<h3>In VR</h3>

					<p>When you enter a space, each hand held controller will not be active until you press a button. Press any button to make your hands appear.</p>

					<p>To point at an object, rest your thumb on the thumbpad or thumbstick directly underneath your thumb. Do not depress the pad or stick like pressing a button, just rest your thumb lightly on the pad or stick. You should see a laser shoot out of your hand. Use this to point at things.</p>

					<p>Things often have a primary action. For example, a light switch's primary action would be to toggle a light on and off. To activate an object's primary action, point at it (described above) and then press harder to click the thumbpad or thumbstick like a button.</p>

					<p>Some things have a secondary action. The most common secondary action allows a thing to be dragged to move it in space. If your controller has a trigger button underneath your index finger, use this to activate the secondard action. For example, to move a thing you point at it (described above) and then depress and hold down the trigger while moving the thing.</p>

					<h2>Building models</h2>

					<p>Spacibl&#333; can arrange models in space, but does not itself provide 3D modeling tools. Luckily, there are great free applications that make it pretty easy to create models for your space.</p>

					<h3>On your PC</h3>

					<p><a href="http://blender.org/">Blender</a></p>

					<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/paint-3d/9nblggh5fv99">Microsoft Paint 3D</a></p>

					<h3>In VR</h3>

					<h2>Creating spaces</h2>

					<p>If you see an inventory link in the upper right corner of the page, then you have access to the template, space, and avatar editors. These give you access to the models, scripts, and configuration for everything in spaces.</p>

					<p>Currently, Spacibl&#333;'s only in-space option for editing is to drag and move things, as described above. Use the editors linked below to edit templates, spaces, and avatars.</p>

					<h3>Templates</h3>

					<p>Things in spaces are made from the files and settings found in templates. Think of a template as a blueprint from which things are made. <a href="/i/#templates/">The template editor</a> allows you to create and edit the blueprint.</p>

					<h3>Spaces</h3>

					<p>This site holds multiple spaces, each with their own set of things and settings. Think of a space as its own little universe, separate from every other space, even if spaces use the same templates to make things. <a href="/i/#spaces/">The space editor</a> gives you control over the position and settings of every thing in each space.</p>

					<h3>Avatars</h3>

					<p>Each avatar available in <a href="/i/#avatars/">the avatar editor</a> can be used multiple times by different people, regardless of whether they are on at the same time. So, many instances of an avatar may appear in a space at the same time.</p>
