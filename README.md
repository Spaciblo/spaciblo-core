# Spaciblō Core

The Spaciblō project builds hosting tools for browser based, social, 3D spaces. 

We're in the process of switching over to a new set of languages and standards for Spaciblō. 

This repository will hold the Go based implementation of the Spaciblō tools. The [Spaciblō](https://github.com/Spaciblo/spaciblo) repository will hold the project-wide documents and wiki. 

Watch this space.
